        Last time I wrote a poem. But now I need some more text, so I'm going to write some stuff here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The poem I wrote is called a Limerick.
      </p>

        <q>A limerick is a five-line poem that consists of a single stanza, an AABBA rhyme scheme, and whose subject is a short, pithy tale or description.</q> - Poetry 101 by Masterclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limericks are usually known by the <q>There once was a...</q> opening and they are supposed to be quite witty.

      <p>There once was an HTML</p>
      <p>Whose job was to know how to tell</p>
      <p>The way to display</p>
      <p>Everything that I say</p>
      <p>As long as I bracket it well</p>
