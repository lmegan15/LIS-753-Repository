          Hello! My name is Laura Egan, and I’ve been singing in choirs since I was 7 years old. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I can usually be found humming something, or that I listen to music pretty much all the time. Although I think my main inspiration was beautiful princesses who sang their way to true love, my parents were the ones that introduced me to classical and choral music by singing together as a family and getting me involved in church choir as a kid.

          In college, I sang with the Wheaton College Women’s Chorale, and I was able to delve deeper into the challenge and reward of singing in a choir. I love the excitement of performing and the way the notes feel when I sing them, but the beauty of a choir is that the individual voice becomes part of a bigger sound and vision that can only be achieved when a group sings together as one. Through this group I met some of my best friends to this day, traveled throughout the US and Europe, and got to be part of a strong community of women who were passionate about the same things I am.

          Sadly, my time in Women’s Chorale was cut short by the pandemic, which is reflected in the short list of repertoire from the 2019-2020 school year. However, once the world began to get back to normal, several of my choir friends and I realized that being able to sing together in person was something we deeply missed and sorely needed in our lives. An informal group of us started meeting in the summer of 2021, singing together on weekends, and planning activities to serve others through our music. I’m so thankful for this group which allows me to continue learning and growing even after I thought my years in choir were over.

          If I’ve learned one thing in choir, it’s that musical communities are all about sharing ideas and working together. As my friends and I run this small choir by ourselves, we each suggest pieces we’ve sung in the past, or heard from other groups. Thus, I decided to compile a portfolio of the pieces I’ve sung as part of Women’s Chorale, to get them all in one place and to visualize the accomplishment of learning them all. The pieces are organized by academic year, and some of them include links to the performance I was actually in. If there’s not a video of the performance, I’ve included links to other recordings available on YouTube and/or Spotify. Please enjoy listening to these songs that we worked hard to learn and perform, and I hope that you are inspired to seek out opportunities to add beauty to your life in whatever ways are life-giving to you!
